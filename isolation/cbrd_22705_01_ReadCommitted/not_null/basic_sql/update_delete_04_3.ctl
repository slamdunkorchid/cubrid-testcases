/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent UPDATE/DELETE transactions in MVCC (with NOT NULL constraint)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 update doesn't affect C2 delete
C1 update instances intersect with C2 delete instances
C1 where clause is not on index (heap scan), C2 where clause is on index (index scan)
C1 updates a index column to null (breaks index)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(Unique + simple), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances will be updated 
   C2 instances will be deleted after reevaluation (Visibility/Reevaluation Test) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
