Test Case: update & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/common_index/basic_sql/update_delete_08.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped initially (with single index),
but C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped initially (based on where clause)
C1's updating the instances equal to the C2's deleting instances 
C1's updated results do affect all the C2's deleting instances
C1 where clause is on index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)  
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = single index, data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances won't be deleted since the search condition is not satisfied 
   (i.e.the version will be updated, the search condition of C2 is not satisfied anymore)   

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
