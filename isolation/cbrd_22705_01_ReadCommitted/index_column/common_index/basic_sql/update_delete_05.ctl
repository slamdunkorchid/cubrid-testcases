/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped (with single index)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (whole table execution, no where clause)
C1 update all the instances of the table, C2 delete all the instances of the table
C1 updates index column
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = no, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances will be deleted
   (i.e.the version will be updated for both C1 and C2) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;

/* preparation */
C1: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
C1: CREATE TABLE t1(id INT, col VARCHAR(10), tag VARCHAR(2));
C1: CREATE INDEX idx_id on t1(id) with online parallel 2;
C1: INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,'abc','A'),(2,'def','B'),(3,'ghi','C'),(4,'jkl','D'),(5,'mno','E'),(6,'pqr','F'),(7,'abc','G');
C1: COMMIT WORK;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

/* test case */
C1: UPDATE t1 SET col = 'abcd', id = 0;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

C2: DELETE FROM t1;
/* expect: C2 needs to wait once C1 completed */
MC: wait until C2 blocked;

/* expect: C1 select - all instances are updated */
C1: SELECT * FROM t1 order by 1,2,3;
C1: commit;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

/* expect: 7 rows deleted message should generated once C2 ready, C2 select - all instances are deleted */
MC: wait until C2 ready;

C2: SELECT * FROM t1 order by 1,2,3;
C2: commit;
MC: wait until C2 ready;

/* expect: all the instances of t1 are deleted */
C3: select * from t1 order by 1,2,3;
MC: wait until C3 ready;

C1: quit;
C2: quit;
