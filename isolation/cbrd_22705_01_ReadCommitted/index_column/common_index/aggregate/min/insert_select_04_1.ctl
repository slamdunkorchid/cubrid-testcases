Test Case: insert & select
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
changes committed after the query started are never seen
desc index, min value has a lot of version

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: set @newincr=0;
C1: insert into t select (@newincr:=@newincr+1)+10,'z' from db_class a,db_class b limit 10;
C2: select min(id) from t where id>0;      -- can not see C1's insert min value
C1: select min(col) from t where col>'a';  -- can see min value inserted by itself
