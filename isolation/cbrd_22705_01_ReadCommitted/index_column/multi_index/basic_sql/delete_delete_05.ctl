Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are overlapped (with multiple indexes)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped
C1,C2 where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 where clause uses single index, C2 where clause uses another index
C1 delete instances equal to the instances from C2 delete 
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(2 simple indexes), where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait C1 completed
2) The instances of C1 will be deleted, the instances of C2 won't be deleted
   (i.e.the version will be updated, the C2 search condition is not satisfied anymore)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
