Test Case: update & select
Priority: 1

Author: Mandy

Test Point:
1. Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
2. Uncommitted data or changes committed after the query started are never seen;
3. The only visible uncommitted data are the effects of current transaction's dates, that is to say
   the new version is only visible to the current transaction
C1, C2 update, no-overlap; C3 select

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update on table t1, commited
C2: update on table t1, not commited 
C2: select on table t1. there are two versions for the specific rows.
