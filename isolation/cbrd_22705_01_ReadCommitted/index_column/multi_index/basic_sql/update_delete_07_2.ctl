/*
Test Case: update & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/multi_index/basic_sql/update_delete_07.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped initially (with multiple indexes),
but C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped initially (based on where clause) 
C1's updated results do affect a portion of the C2's deleting instances
C1 where clause is not on index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause is on index (heap scan) 
C1 updates index columns 
C2 commit, C1 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = multiple indexes(Unique + Simple index), data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances should be deleted first, C2 instances should be updated based on the original search condition  

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
