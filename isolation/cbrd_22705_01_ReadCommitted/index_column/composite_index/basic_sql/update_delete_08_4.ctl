Test Case: update & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/composite_index/basic_sql/update_delete_08.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped initially (with composite index),
but C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped initially (based on where clause) 
C1's updating the instances intersect with in the C2's deleting instances 
C1's updated results do affect a portion the C2's deleting instances
C1,C2 where clauses are not on index (heap scan)  
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = composite index(unique), data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances which still satisfy the search condition will be deleted but others will not 
   (i.e.the version will be updated, the search condition of C2 is partially satisfied)  

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
