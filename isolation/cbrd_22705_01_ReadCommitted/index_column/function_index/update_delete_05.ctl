Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped (with function index)
C1 update affect C2 delete

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's update affect the C2's delete
C1 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause doesn't use function index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = composite function index(ABS + LENGTH), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed  
2) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted after reevaluation

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C1: CREATE INDEX idx_id on t1(ABS(id)) with online parallel 2;
C1: CREATE INDEX idx_col on t1(LENGTH(col)) with online parallel 2;
