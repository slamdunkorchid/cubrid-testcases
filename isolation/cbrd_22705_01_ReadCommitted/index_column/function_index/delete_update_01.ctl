/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE/UPDATE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with function index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1,C2 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single function index(TRIM), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be updated

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;
