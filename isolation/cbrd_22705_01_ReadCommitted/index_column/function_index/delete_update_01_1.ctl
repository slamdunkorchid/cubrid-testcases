/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/function_index/basic_sql/delete_update_01.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE/UPDATE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with function index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 where clause uses function index(index) , C2 where clause doesn't use filtered index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single function index(LENGTH), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be updated

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;
