/*
Test Case: delete & insert
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/primary_key_column/basic_sql/insert_delete_05.ctl
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
If a transaction updates its own inserted record. The record is only visible to its owner until it is committed,
therefore no other transaction can read/modify it
one user insert, another insert, then delete user1's value

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: insert into t values(2,'c');
C2: insert into t values(3,'abc');
C2: delete from t where trim(col)='c'; --expected can not see (2,'c'), delete failed
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 2;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

/* preparation */
C1: drop table if exists t;
C1: create table t(id int,col varchar(10));
C1: create index idx on t(trim(col)) with online parallel 2;
C1: commit work;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

/* test case */
C1: insert into t values(2,'c');
MC: wait until C1 ready;

C2: insert into t values(3,'abc');

/* expected can not see (2,'c'), delete failed */
C2: delete from t where trim(col)='c';
