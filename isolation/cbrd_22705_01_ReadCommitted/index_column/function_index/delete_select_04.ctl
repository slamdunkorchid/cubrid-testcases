Test Point:
-    delete: X_LOCK acquired on current instance..
-    select: no row locks acquired but IS_LOCK for table,
C1 delete rows, C2 select rows, overlapped.
transactions are not blocked.
LEFT function index on two columns

NUM_CLIENTS = 2  -- use same index
C1: delete from tb1; 
C2: select * from tb1 order by 1,2;
