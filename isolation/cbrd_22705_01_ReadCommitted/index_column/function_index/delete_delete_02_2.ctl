/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/function_index/delete_delete_01.ctl/delete_delete_02.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are overlapped (with function index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause uses unique index (index scan) 
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single function index(LEFT) + PK, where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be deleted after reevaluation

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
