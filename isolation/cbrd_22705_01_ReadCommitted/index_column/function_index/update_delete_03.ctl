/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped initially(with function index)
but C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances, C2 execution takes a long time (finished after C1 commit)  

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances
C2 execution takes a long time (finished after C1 commit)  
C1 where clause uses one function index (index scan), C2 where clause uses another function index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple function indexes (YEAR + MONTH), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be updated 
   C2 instances should be deleted based on its original snapshot

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
