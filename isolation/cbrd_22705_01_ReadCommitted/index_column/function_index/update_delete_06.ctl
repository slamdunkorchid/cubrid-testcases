/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped (with function index)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's update does not affect the C2's delete
C1,C2 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple function indexes(MONTH + YEAR), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed  
2) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted after reevaluation

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;
