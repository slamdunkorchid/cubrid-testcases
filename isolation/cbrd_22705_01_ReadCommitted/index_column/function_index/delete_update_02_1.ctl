/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/function_index/basic_sql/delete_update_02.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE/UPDATE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with filtered index)
C1 try to delete a unique index that C2 try to update to

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 try to delete an unique index that C2 try to update to 
C1 where clause uses function index (index scan), C2 where clause uses the unique index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single function index(LEFT) + PK, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances should be deleted since C1 commit
   C2 instances should be updated since the duplicate key has been removed (after reevaluation)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
