/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/function_index/delete_delete_01.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with function index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause uses another index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single function index(TRIM) + simele index, where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
