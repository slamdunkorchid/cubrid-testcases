Test Case: insert & update
Priority: 1
Reference case: 
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
insert and update changed a lot of filter index value, check select result
update more value in filter index to values which not satisfy filter condition
update more value not in filter index to values which satisfy filter condition

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C2 select
C1 insert a value which satisfy filter condition
C1 update the above value to which don't satisfy filter condition
C1 select using filter index
C2 select

C1: update t set id=id*2; 
The update will be blocked by C2:
C2: select sum(id),sum(col) from t where id%2=0 using index idx(+);
because C2 holds IX-lock on t and C1 wants to hold X-lock.
