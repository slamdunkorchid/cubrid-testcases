Test Case: insert & select
Priority: 2

Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
1. Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
2. Uncommitted data or changes committed after the query started are never seen
A begin select
                   B begin insert
                   B commit
A end select
A commit

MC: sleep 1;
