/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: SIGN/ABS

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC UPDATE/DELETE scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance) if using multiple numeric functions in queries, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped 
C1 update does affect C2 delete, C2 takes a long time (finished after C1 completed)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 update does affect C2 delete
C2 takes a long time (finished after C1 completed)
C1 uses SIGN and C2 uses ABS
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances will be updated first, C2 instances will be deleted based on its own snapshot 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results
