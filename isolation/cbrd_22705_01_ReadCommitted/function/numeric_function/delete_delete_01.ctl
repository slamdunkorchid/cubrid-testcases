/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: MOD

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance) if using numeric function MOD in delete queries, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses MOD and C2 uses MOD
C1 where clause is on index (index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index(Unique), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances will be deleted, C2 instances will be deleted 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results
