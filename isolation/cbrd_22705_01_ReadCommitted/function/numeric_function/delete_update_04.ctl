/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: POW

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE/UPDATE scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance) if using numeric function POW in queries, 
and the affected rows are overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the selected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses POW and C2 uses POW
C1 where clause is on index (index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = function index(POW), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be deleted, C2 instances will be updated after reevaluation 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results
