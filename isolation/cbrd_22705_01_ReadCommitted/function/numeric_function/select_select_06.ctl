/*
Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR/ABS

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT scenarios (locks - IX_LOCK) if using numeric + information functions in select queries, 
and the affected rows are overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses DECR/ABS and C2 uses INCR/ABS
C1 DECR affect C2 INCR
C1,C2's where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated by using DECR
   C2 instances will be updated after reevaluation 

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: select from table t1;   
C2: select from table t1;
