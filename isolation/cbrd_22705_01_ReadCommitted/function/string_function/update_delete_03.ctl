/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent UPDATE/DELETE transactions in MVCC if using string function 
String Function(single): REVERSE

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 update does affect C2 delete
C2 takes a long time (finished after C1 completed)
C1 uses REVERSE and C2 uses REVERSE
C1,C2 where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = function index(REVERSE), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances will be updated first 
   C2 instances will be deleted based on its own snapshot (Visibility Testing)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
