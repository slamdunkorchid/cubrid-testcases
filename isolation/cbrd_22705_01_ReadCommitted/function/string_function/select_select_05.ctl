Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent SELECT transactions in MVCC if using string function and incr/decr 
String Function(single): TRIM
Information Function: INCR/DECR

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses INCR/TRIM and C2 uses DECR
C1 INCR affect C2 DECR
C1 where clause is on index (index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(Unique + function), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances will be updated by using INCR, C2 instances will be updated by using DECR (Visibility Testing)

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: select from table t1;   
C2: select from table t1;
