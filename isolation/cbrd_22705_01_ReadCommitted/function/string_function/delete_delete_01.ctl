Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE transactions in MVCC if using string function 
String Function(single): CONCAT

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses CONCAT and C2 uses CONCAT
C1,C2's where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances will be deleted, C2 instances will be deleted (Visibility Testing) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check for the updated results 
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;
