Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC if using string function 
String Function(single): RTRIM

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C2 try to update an unique index to which C1 is trying to delete 
C1 uses RTRIM and C2 uses RTRIM
C1,C2's where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(PK + function), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances will be deleted, C2 instances will be updated since the duplicate key has been removed
   (Visibility/Reevaluation Testing) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results
