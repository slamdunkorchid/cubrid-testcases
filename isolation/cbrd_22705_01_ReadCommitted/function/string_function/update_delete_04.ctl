/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent UPDATE/DELETE transactions in MVCC if using string function 
String Function(multiple): CHAR_LENGTH/TRIM

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the selected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 update doesn't affect C2 delete
C1 uses CHAR_LENGTH and C2 uses CHAR_LENGTH(TRIM)
C1,C2's where clauses are on index(index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple function indexes(CHAR_LENGTH+TRIM), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances will be deleted after reevaluation (Visibility/Reevaluation Testing)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;
