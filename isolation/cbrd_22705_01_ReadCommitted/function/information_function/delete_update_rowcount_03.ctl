Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: ROW_COUNT()

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE/DELETE scenarios if using information function ROW_COUNT in the query
and the affected rows are not overlapped
C2 update affect C1 delete, C1 finishes execution after C2 commit since C1 takes a long time

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C2 update does affect C1 delete
C1 finishes execution after C2 commit since C1 takes a long time
C1 selects ROW_COUNT, C2 selects ROW_COUNT
C1 where clause is not on index (i.e. heap scan), C2 where clause is on index (index scan)
C2 commit, C1 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances should be updated first, the row_count will be returned based on its own snapshot 
   C1 instances should be deleted based on its original snapshot, the row_count will be returned based on its original snapshot 

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: delete from table t1;  select row_count from table t1;
C2: update table t1;  select row_count from table t1;
