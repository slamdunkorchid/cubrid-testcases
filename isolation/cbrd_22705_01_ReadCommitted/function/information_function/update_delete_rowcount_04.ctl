/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: ROW_COUNT()

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC UPDATE/DELETE scenarios if using information function ROW_COUNT in the query
and the affected instances are overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's updates do not affect the C2's deletes
C1 selects ROW_COUNT, C2 selects ROW_COUNT
C1,C2 where clause uses index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed  
2) C1 instances should be updated, the row_count should be returned based on its own snapshot
   C2 instances should be deleted after reevaluation, the row_count should be returned after reevaluation

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: update table t1;  select row_count from table t1; 
C2: delete from table t1;  select row_count from table t1;
