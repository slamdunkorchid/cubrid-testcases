/*
Test Case: select & update 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/function/counter_function/select_update_incrdecr_03.ctl
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT/UPDATE scenarios if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select query, 
and the affected rows are overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 update, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses DECR
C1 select doesn't affect C2 updates
C1,C2 where clauses are all on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = composite index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated(decrement) by using INCR function 
   C2 instances will be updated after reevaluation 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select decr from table t1;   
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
