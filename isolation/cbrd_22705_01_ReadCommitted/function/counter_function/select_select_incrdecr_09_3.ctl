/*
Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/function/counter_function/select_select_incrdecr_09.ctl
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT scenarios (locks - IX_LOCK) if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select queries, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped, C2 select does affect C1 select
C1 select takes a long time (finishes the execution after C2 commit)

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses DECR and C2 uses DECR
C2 select does affect C1 select
C1 select takes a long time (finishes the execution after C2 commit)
C1 where clause is on one filtered index (index scan - totally), C2 where clause is on another filtered index (index scan - totally) 
C2 commit, C1 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple filtered index(2 indexes), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances will be updated(decrement) first
   C1 instances will be updated(decrement) based on its original snapshot 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select decr from table t1;   
C2: select decr from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
