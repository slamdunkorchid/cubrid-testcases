Test Case: delete & insert
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes.
-    Delete: X_LOCK acquired on current instance 
A begin delete
                   B begin insert
                   B commit
A end delete
A commit
A using unique index, B using two index
