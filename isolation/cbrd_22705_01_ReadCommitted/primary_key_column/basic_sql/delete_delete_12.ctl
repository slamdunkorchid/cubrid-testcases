Test Case: delete & delete
Priority: 1
Reference case: 
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are overlapped (with pk schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped
C1 delete instances are included in the instances from C2 delete 
C1 where clause is not on pk (heap scan), C2 where clause is on pk (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = with pk, data size = small, where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait C1 completed 
2) The instances of C1 will be deleted, the overlapped C2 instances won't be deleted but the remained(non-overlapped) instances will 
   (i.e.the version will be updated, the C2 search condition is partially satisfied)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
