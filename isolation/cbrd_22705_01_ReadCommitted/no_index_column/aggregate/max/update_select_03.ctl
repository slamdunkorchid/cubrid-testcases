Test Case: update & select
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Mandy

Test Point:
Test the visibility of uncommited data
1. Uncommitted data are never seen by other queries
2. The only visible uncommitted data are the effects of current transaction's dates, that is to say
   the new version is only visible to the current transaction
At the same time, check update does not block select.
