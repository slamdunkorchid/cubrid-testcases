/*
Test Case: delete & select
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/no_index_column/join/select_delete_05.ctl
Author: Lily

Test Point:
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) and SELECT not need locks, they are not blocked each other.

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, join query = left [outer] join, where clause = simple (multiple columns)

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: select from table tb1 left join table tb2;  
C2: delete from table tb1 left join table tb2;  
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 2;
C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
