/*
Test Case: delete & insert
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/primary_key_column/basic_sql/delete_insert_02.ctl
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes.
-    Delete: X_LOCK acquired on current instance
one user delete,insert, another insert,delete;check will not cause deadlock
