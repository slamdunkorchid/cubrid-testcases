/*
Test Case: delete & update
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_02_RepeatableRead/index_column/function_index/delete_update_05.ctl
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with function index schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 C2 where clauses are on index (i.e. index scan)
C2 try to update an unique key which C1 try to delete
C1 rollback, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = function index(LENGTH), data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own delete/update but not other transactions changes (Visibility Test) 
3) C1 instances shouldn't be deleted since rollback, C2 instances shouldn't be updated since an unique key violation

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
