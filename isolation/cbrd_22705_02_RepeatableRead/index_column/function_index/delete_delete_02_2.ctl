Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_02_RepeatableRead/index_column/function_index/delete_delete_02.ctl
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE transactions in MVCC (with function index schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 C2 where clause doesn't uses index (sequence scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = function index(MONTH+YEAR), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 doesn't need to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own deletion but not other transactions deletion (Visibility Test)
3) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted (Visibility Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
