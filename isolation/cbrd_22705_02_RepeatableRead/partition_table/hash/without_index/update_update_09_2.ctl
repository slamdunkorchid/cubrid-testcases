Test Case: update & update

Author: Mandy

Test Point:
When two transaction update the same record, the second updater can proceed only if the first transaction rollbacks.
If the first transaction commits, the second transaction must be aborted.

In this case, 3 transations update overlapped data. 

NUM_CLIENTS = 4 
C1: update on table t1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. C1 block C2 and C3 on different objects   
C2: update on table t1: 3, 4, 5, 6. (Transaction C2 is blocked, waiting for lock on 3ï¼‰
C3: update on table t1: 4, 5, 6. (Transaction C3 is blocked, waiting for lock on 4)
C4: C4 select on table t1, this client is used to check the update result
