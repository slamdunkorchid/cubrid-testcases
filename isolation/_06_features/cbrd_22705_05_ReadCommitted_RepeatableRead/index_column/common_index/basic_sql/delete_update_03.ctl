/*
Test Case: delete & update
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with single index schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 where clause is on index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (sequence scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = single index, data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 doesn't need to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own delete/update but not other transactions changes (Visibility Test) 
3) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be updated

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
