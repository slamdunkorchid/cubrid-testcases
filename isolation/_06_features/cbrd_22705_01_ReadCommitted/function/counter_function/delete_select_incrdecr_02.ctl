/*
Test Case: delete & select 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT/DELETE scenarios if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select query, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped, 
C1 try to delete a unique index which is C2 try to updating to

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 select, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C2 uses INCR on unique column
C1 try to delete a unique index which is C2 try to updating to
C1 where clause is not no index (heap scan), C2 where clause is on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index(Unique), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed 
2) C1 instances will be deleted first 
   C2 instances will be updated(increment) since the duplicate key has been deleted 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: deleted from table t1;   
C2: select incr from table t1 order by 1,2;
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
