/*
Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/function/counter_function/select_select_incrdecr_10.ctl
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT scenarios (locks - IX_LOCK) if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in one select query, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped, only one transaction uses incr/decr, C1 decr affect C2 select

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses DECR
C1 decr affect C2 select
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instance will be updated(decrement), C2 see the instances based on its original snapshot

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select incr from table t1;   
C2: select from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
