/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/function/information_function/delete_delete_rowcount_02.ctl
Author: Ray
Function: ROW_COUNT()

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE/DELETE scenarios if using information function ROW_COUNT in the query
and the affected instances are overlapped  

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected instances are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 selects ROW_COUNT, C2 selects ROW_COUNT
C1,C2 where clause are on indexes (index scan)
C1 rollback, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = function index(LENGTH), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances won't be deleted since C1 rollback, the row_count requested by C1 will be retrieved based on its own snapshot(session) 
   C2 instances will be deleted, the row_count requested by C2 will be retrieved after reevaluation 

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: deleted from table t1; select row_count from table t1;
C2: deleted from table t1; select row_count from table t1;
