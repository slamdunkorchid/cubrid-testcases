Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: ROW_COUNT()

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC UPDATE/DELETE scenarios if using information function ROW_COUNT in the query
and the affected instances are not overlapped  

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 selects ROW_COUNT, C2 selects ROW_COUNT
C1's updates do not affect the C2's deletes
C1,C2 where clauses are on index (i.e. index scan)
All C1, C2 instances are using index scan
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be updated, the row_count requested by C1 will be retrieved based on its own snapshot(session) 
   C2 instances should be deleted, the row_count requested by C2 will be retrieved based on its own snapshot(session)

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: update table t1; select row_count from table t1; 
C2: delete from table t1;  select row_count from table t1;
