/*
Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR/POWER

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT scenarios (locks - IX_LOCK) if using numeric + information functions in select queries, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses INCR/POWER and C2 uses DECR/POWER
C1 INCR affect C2 DECR
C1,C2's where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(Unique + simple), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances will be updated by using INCR, C2 instances will be updated by using DECR 

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: select from table t1;   
C2: select from table t1;
