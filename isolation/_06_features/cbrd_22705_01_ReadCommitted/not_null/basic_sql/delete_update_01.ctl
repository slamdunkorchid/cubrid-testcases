/*
Test Case: delete & update
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with NOT NULL constraint)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1, C2 where clause are all on NOT NULL column (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: index = single index(Unique), data size = small, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances should be deleted based on its own snapshot
   C2 instances should be updated based on its own snapshot (Visibility Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check for the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;
