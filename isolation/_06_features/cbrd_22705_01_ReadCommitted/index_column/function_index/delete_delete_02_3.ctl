/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/function_index/delete_delete_01.ctl/delete_delete_02.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are overlapped (with function index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1,C2's where clauses use function index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple function index(MONTH+YEAR), where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be deleted after reevaluation

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
