/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE/UPDATE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with function index)
C2 update affect C1 delete, C1 finishes execution after C2 commit since C1 takes a long time

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C2 update does affect C1 delete
C1 finishes execution after C2 commit since C1 takes a long time
C1,C2 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan)
C2 commit, C1 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple function indexes(ABS+LENGTH), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances should be updated first, C1 instances should be deleted based on its original snapshot

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
