/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/common_index/basic_sql/delete_delete_09.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are overlapped (with single index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1,C2 where clause are not on index (i.e. heap scan)
C1 delete instances are intersected with the instances from C2 delete 
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index(Unique), where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait C1 completed
2) The instances of C1 will be deleted, the overlapped C2 instances won't be deleted but the remained instances (non-overlapped) will be
   (i.e.the version will be updated, the C2 search condition is partially satisfied) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
