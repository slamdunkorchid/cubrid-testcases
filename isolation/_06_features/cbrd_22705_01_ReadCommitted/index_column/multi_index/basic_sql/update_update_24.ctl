Test Case: update & update 
Priority: 1 
Reference case:
Author: Mandy

Test Point: 
A target record may be already locked and modified (updated or deleted) by another transaction. In this case:
1. current transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or rollback. 
2. if the first transaction rollbacks, the second can proceed with updating the original record.
In this case, 2 indexes are created

NUM_CLIENTS = 3 
C1: update on table t1; rollback  
C2: update on table t1
C3: select on table t1, and C3 is used to check the update result      
*/


MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;

/* preparation */
C1: drop table if exists t1;
C1: create table t1(id int, col varchar(10));
C1: insert into t1 values(1,'abc'),(2,'def'),(3,'abc'),(3,'def'),(4,'ijk'),(5,'gh');
C1: create index idx1 on t1(id) with online parallel 2;
C1: create index idx2 on t1(id, col) with online parallel 2;
C1: commit work;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

/* test case */
C1: update t1 set id=1 where id=3;
MC: wait until C1 ready;
C2: update t1 set id=4 where id=3 and col='abc';
MC: wait until C2 blocked;
C1: rollback;
MC: wait until C2 ready;
C2: commit;
C3: select * from t1 order by 1,2;

C1: quit;
C2: quit;
C3: quit;
