Test Case: update & update
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/primary_key_column/basic_sql/update_update12.ctl
Author: Mandy

Test Point:
A target record may be already locked and modified (updated or deleted) by another transaction. In this case:
1. current transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or rollback.
2. if the first transaction rollbacks, the second can proceed with updating the original record.
In this case, the final result may be different, since we cannot decide which blocked client cant get the lock first. So we need
2 answer files.
C1 update; then C2 and C3 update at the same time.

NUM_CLIENTS = 4
C1: update on table t1
C2: update on table t1;if C3 get the lock first, C2 will re-evaluate and dose nothing
C3: update on table t1;if C2 get the lock first, C3 will re-evlauate and update
C4: C4 select on table t1, this client is used to check the update result
