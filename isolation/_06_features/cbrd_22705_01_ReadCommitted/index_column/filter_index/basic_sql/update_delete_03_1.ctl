Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with filtered index)
C1's update does affect the C2's delete, C2 execution takes a long time (finished after C1 commit)  

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's update does affect the C2's delete
C2 execution takes a long time (finished after C1 commit)  
C1 updates index column
C1,C2 where clause uses filtered index (i.e. index scan - totally)
All C1, C2 instances are using index scan
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single filtered index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 do not need to wait  
2) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted based on its original snapshot

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
