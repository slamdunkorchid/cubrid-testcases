/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/filter_index/basic_sql/delete_delete_02.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are overlapped (with filtered index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1,C2 where clause uses filtered index (index scan - partially)
A portion of C1,C2 instances are using filtered index scan
C1 rollback, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single filtered index, where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed 
2) C1 instances shouldn't be deleted since C1 rollback
   all C2 instances should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
