Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/multi_index/basic_sql/delete_update_06.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE/UPDATE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped (with multiple indexes)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's deleting the instances intersect with in the C2's updating instances
C1,C2's where clause are not on index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(PK + Unique + Composite index), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be deleted, the overlapped C2 instances won't be updated but the remained instances (non-overlapped) will be 
   (i.e. the version will be deleted, C2's search condition is partially satisfied)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1;    
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
