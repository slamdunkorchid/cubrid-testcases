/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped initially(with function index)
but C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances
C1,C2 where clause uses function index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = funtion index(LENGTH), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be updated 
   C2 instances should be deleted based on its original snapshot

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
