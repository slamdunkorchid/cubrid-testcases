/*
Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/function/counter_function/select_select_incrdecr_05.ctl
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance ??) if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select queries 
but the affected rows are overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses INCR and C2 uses DECR
C1 where clause is on index (index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 rollback, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(2 simple indexes), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated(increment) even if C1 rollback, C2 instances will be updated(decrement) based on the reevaluation.

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select from table t1;   
C2: select from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
