/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: ROW_COUNT()

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE/DELETE scenarios if using information function ROW_COUNT in the query
and the affected rows are not overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 selects ROW_COUNT, C2 selects ROW_COUNT
C1,C2 where clause uses index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be deleted, the row_count will be returned based on its own snapshot 
   C2 instances should be updated, the row_count will be returned based on its own snapshot 

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: delete from table t1;  select row_count from table t1;
C2: update table t1;  select row_count from table t1;
