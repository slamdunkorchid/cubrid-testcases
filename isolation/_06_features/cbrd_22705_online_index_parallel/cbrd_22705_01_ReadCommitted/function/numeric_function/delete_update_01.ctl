/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: MOD

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE/UPDATE scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance) if using numeric function MOD in queries, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses MOD and C2 uses MOD
C1,C2's where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index(Unique), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances will be deleted, C2 instances will be updated 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results
