Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Related Issue: CUBRIDSUS-14336
Function: FLOOR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC UPDATE/DELETE scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance) if using numeric function FLOOR in queries,
and the affected rows are overlapped, C1 update does affect C2 delete

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the selected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 update does affect C2 delete
C1 uses FLOOR and C2 uses FLOOR
C1,C2's where clauses are on index(index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances will be deleted after reevaluation 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1; 
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated results
