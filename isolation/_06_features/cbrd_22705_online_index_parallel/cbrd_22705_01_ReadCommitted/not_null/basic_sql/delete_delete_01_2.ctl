/*
Test Case: delete & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/not_null/basic_sql/delete_delete_01.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE transactions in MVCC (with NOT NULL constraint)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 where clause is on index (index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 rollback, C2 commit
Metrics: index = single index(Unique), data size = small, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C1 instances shouldn't be deleted since C1 rollback
   C2 instances should be deleted (Visibility Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
