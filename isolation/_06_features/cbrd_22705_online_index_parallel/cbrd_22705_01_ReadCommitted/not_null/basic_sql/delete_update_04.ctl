/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with NOT NULL constraint)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 delete instances equal to C2 update instances
C1,C2's where clauses are on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index(unique), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) All the C1 instances will be deleted
   All the C2 instances won't be updated after reevaluation (Visibility/Reevaluation Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check for the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;
