/*
Test Case: update & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/multi_index/basic_sql/update_delete_07.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped initially (with multiple indexes),
but C1's updated results affect the C2's deleting instances

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped initially (based on where clause) 
C1's updated results do affect a portion of the C2's deleting instances
C1 C2's where clauses are not on index (heap scan)  
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = multiple indexes (PK + Unique), data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted based on the original search condition  

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
