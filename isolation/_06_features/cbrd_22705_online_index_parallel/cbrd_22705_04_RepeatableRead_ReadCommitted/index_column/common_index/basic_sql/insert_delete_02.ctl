/*
Test Case: insert & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/primary_key_column/basic_sql/insert_delete_02.ctl
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
If a transaction updates its own inserted record. The record is only visible to its owner until it is committed,
therefore no other transaction can read/modify it
one user insert and then delete in-place, another delete the whole table

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: insert(1)
C2: delete from t --ready, can not see insert value
C1: delete(1)
C1: commit
C2: commit
