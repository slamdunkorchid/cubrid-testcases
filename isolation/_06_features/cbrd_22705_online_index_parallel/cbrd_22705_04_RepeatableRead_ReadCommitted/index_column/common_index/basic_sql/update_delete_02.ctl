/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with single index)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's updates do not affect the C2's deletes
C1's where clause is on index (i.e. index scan), C2's where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index(Unique), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
