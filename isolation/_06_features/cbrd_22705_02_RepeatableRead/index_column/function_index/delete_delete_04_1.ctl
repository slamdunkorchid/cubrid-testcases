Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE transactions in MVCC (with function index schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 C2 where clauses use function index (i.e. index scan)
C1 delete instances intersect with C2 delete instances
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = function index(MONTH+YEAR), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own deletion but not other transactions deletion (Visibility Test)
3) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted (Visibility Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
