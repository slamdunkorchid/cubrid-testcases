/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE/UPDATE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with single index)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C2 try to update an unique index column to a duplicate key which is C1 try to deleting 
C1, C2 where clauses are on index column (index scan) 
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index (Unique), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be updated (since the duplicate key has been deleted)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
