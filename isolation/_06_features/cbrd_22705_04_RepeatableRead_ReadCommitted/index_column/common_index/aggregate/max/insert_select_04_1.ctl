Test Case: insert & select
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
changes committed after the query started are never seen
desc index, max value has a lot of version

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: insert into t select rownum+10,'z' from db_class a,db_class b where rownum <= 10;
C2: select max(id) from t where id>0;      -- can not see C1's insert max value
C1: select max(col) from t where col>'a';  -- can see max value inserted by itself
*/
