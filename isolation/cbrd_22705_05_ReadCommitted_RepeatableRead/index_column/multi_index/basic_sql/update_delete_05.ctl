/*
Test Case: update & delete
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent UPDATE/DELETE transactions in MVCC (with multiple indexes schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped
C1, C2 where clause are on different index column (i.e. index range scan) 
C1 update does affect C2 delete
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = multiple indexes (2 simple), data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed(Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own update/delete but not other transactions changes (Visibility Test) 
3) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
