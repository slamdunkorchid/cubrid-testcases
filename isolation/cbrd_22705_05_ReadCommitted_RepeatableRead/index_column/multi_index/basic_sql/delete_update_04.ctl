Test Case: delete & update
Priority: 1
Reference case: 
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with multiple indexes schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1, C2 where clauses are on indexes (i.e. index scan)
C2 try to update an unique index column to a duplicate key which is C1 try to deleting 
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = multiple indexes(Unique + simple), data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own delete/update but not other transactions changes (Visibility Test) 
3) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances should be updated

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
