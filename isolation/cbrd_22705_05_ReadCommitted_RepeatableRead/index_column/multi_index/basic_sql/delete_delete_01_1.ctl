Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: 
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE transactions in MVCC (with multiple indexes schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1,C2 where clauses are on different index (i.e. index scan) 
C2 contains a read query before delete
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(PK + simple), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own deletion but not other transactions deletion 
3) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted (Visibility Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
