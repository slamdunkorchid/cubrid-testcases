/*
Test Case: update & delete
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_02_RepeatableRead/index_column/common_index/basic_sql/update_delete_05.ctl
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent UPDATE/DELETE transactions in MVCC (with single column schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's updates do not affect the C2's deletes
C1's updating the instances intersect with the C2's delete instances 
C1 C2 where clause is on index column (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = single index, data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own update/delete but not other transactions changes (Visibility Test) 
3) C1 instances should be updated, C2 instances should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
