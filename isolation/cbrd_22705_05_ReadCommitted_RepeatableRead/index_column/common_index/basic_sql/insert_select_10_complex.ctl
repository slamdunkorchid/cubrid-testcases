Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the transaction began
C1 begin before C2, C2 can not see committed/rollback/uncommitted data by C1

NUM_CLIENTS = 4
C1: insert(2);
C2: insert(4);
C3: insert(2); -- expected blocked
C4: insert(5);
C1: commit work;
C1: insert(8);
C2: commit;
C3: commit;
C4: commit;
C2: select * from t where id>0 order by 1;
C2: commit;
