Test Case: delete & update
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Related issue: CUBRIDSUS-14442
Isolation Level: Repeatable Read
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with single index schema)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 C2 where clauses are not on index (i.e. sequence scan)
C1's deleting the instances intersect with the C2's updating instances
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: schema = single table, index = single unique index, data size = small, where clause = simple

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed (Locking Test)
2) C1 and C2 can only see the its own delete/update but not other transactions changes (Visibility Test) 
3) C1 instances should be deleted, C2 instances shouldn't be updated since the data is selected

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
