Test Case: insert & delete
Priority: 1
Reference case: 
Author: Rong Xu

Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes
-    Delete: X_LOCK acquired on current instance
there is index on t1(id,col), delete and insert value has overlap on id

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C2: insert into t1 values(5,'123'); -- expected ok, not to be deleted
C1: DELETE FROM t1 WHERE id = 5; -- expected no block
