Test Case: update & select

Author: Mandy

Test Point:
1. Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
2. changes committed after the query started are never seen

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: update, commit after C2's query start
C2: select twice  - before C1 commit, after C1 commit 
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 2;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

/* preparation */
C1: drop table if exists t1;
C1: create table t1(id int, col varchar(10));
C1: insert into t1 values(1,'abc');insert into t1 values(2,'def');insert into t1 values(3,'abc');insert into t1 values(1,'ijk');insert into t1 values(3,'lmn');
C1: create index idx on t1(id) with online parallel 3;
C1: commit;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

/* test case */
C1: update t1 set id=null where id=1;
MC: wait until C1 ready;
/* both get 5*/
C2: select count(col) from t1 where sleep(2)=0 and id>0;
