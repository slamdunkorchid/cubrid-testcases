Author: Mandy

Test Point:
In this case, the first transaction's update result will affect the second transaction's search key value. In this case, the tran
sation is not blocked. Check the second update is executed correctly.

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update on table t1; commit
C2: update on table t1; is not blocked, does not re-evaluate and does not update
C3: select on table t1, and C3 is used to check the update result
