/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped (with single index)
and C1's updated results do not affect the C2's deleting instances

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped (based on where clause)
C1's updating the instances equal to the C2's deleting instances
C1's updated results do not affect the C2's deleting instances
C1, C2 where clause are all on index (i.e. index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = single index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances will be deleted
   (i.e.the version will be updated, the search condition of C2 is still satisfied) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
