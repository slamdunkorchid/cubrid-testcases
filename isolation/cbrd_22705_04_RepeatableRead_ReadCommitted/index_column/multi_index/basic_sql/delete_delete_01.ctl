Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with multiple indexes)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped
C1,C2 where clauses are on index (i.e. index scan)
C1 where clause uses single index, C2 where clause uses another index
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(2 simple indexes), where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 3;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

C3: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C3: set transaction isolation level read committed;
