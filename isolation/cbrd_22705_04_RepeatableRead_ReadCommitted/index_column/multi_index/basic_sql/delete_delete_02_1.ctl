/*
Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/multi_index/basic_sql/delete_delete_02.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the delete instances of the transactions are not overlapped (with multiple indexes)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the affected rows are not overlapped
C1 where clause is on index (i.e. index scan), C2 where clause is not on index (heap scan)
C1 where clause uses single indexes
C2 commit, C1 rollback
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(Unique + simple index), where clause = simple, DELETE state = single table deletion

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances will be deleted first, C1 instances won't be deleted since C1 rollback

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
