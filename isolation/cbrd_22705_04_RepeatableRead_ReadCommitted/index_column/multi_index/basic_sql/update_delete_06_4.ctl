/*
Test Case: update & delete 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/multi_index/basic_sql/update_delete_06.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test UPDATE/DELETE locks (X_LOCK on instance) if the instances of the transactions are overlapped (with multiple indexes)

Test Scenario:
C1 update, C2 delete, the affected rows are overlapped 
C1's updating the instances intersect with the C2's deleting instances
C1's updated results do not affect the C2's deleting instances
C1 where clause is not on index (i.e. heap scan), C2 where clause is on index (index scan)
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple indexes(PK + Unique + Composite index), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C2 needs to wait until C1 completed
2) C1 instances will be updated, C2 instances will be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update table t1;  
C2: delete from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
