Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
one user insert uncommitted, another user select all rows in the same index nodes

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: insert('a ');
C2: select * from t where trim(col)='a' order by 1; --'a ' is invisable
C1: commit
C2: commit

C1: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;
