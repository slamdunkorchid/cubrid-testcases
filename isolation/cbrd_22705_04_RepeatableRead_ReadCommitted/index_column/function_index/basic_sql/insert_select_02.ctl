Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
one user insert uncommitted, another user select all rows on one index nodes

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: insert into t values(2,'ab');
C2: select * from t where LENGTH(col)=2; -- can not see C1's value

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level read committed;

/* preparation */
C1: drop table if exists t;
