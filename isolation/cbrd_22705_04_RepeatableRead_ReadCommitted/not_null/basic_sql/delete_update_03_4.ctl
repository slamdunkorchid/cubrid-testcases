/*
Test Case: delete & update 
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/not_null/basic_sql/delete_update_03.ctl
Author: Ray

Test Plan: 
Test concurrent DELETE/UPDATE transactions in MVCC (with NOT NULL constraint)

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C2 completed before C1 finished execution since C1 takes a long time
C2 update does affect C1 delete
C1,C2's where clauses are on index column (index scan)
C2 rollback, C1 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = multiple index(unique+simple), where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting (Locking Test)
2) C2 instances shouldn't be updated since C2 rollback
   C1 instances should be deleted based on its original snapshot (Visibility Test)

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result
